Selected among approximately 760,000 teams, Diyapatik advanced to the Turkey finals, where we achieved first place. Diyapatik aims to address critical health challenges through innovative technology, providing a valuable tool for users in need.

We are excited to share our journey and make our work accessible to the global community. This repository contains the codebase for Diyapatik, empowering developers and health-tech enthusiasts to explore, contribute, and build on our work.

Let’s drive technology forward for a better tomorrow!
